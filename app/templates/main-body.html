      <p style="margin: 90px 0 50px !important;"><span class="large-p"><span class="dropCap2">L</span>ee Ann Riley still remembers the thrill she felt that summer evening nearly 40 years ago when the handsome, tanned assistant director of The Cadets took her and her twin sister to dinner.</span>
      </p>
      <p>The siblings were just 17, with nearly a decade of color guard experience already behind them. They had learned to twirl batons in the mirrors their mother installed in their Philadelphia living room and early on had set their sights on making The
        Cadets, a competitive drum and bugle corps.</p>






      <p>Hopkins, then 23, was a rising star. Within a few years, he would turn the Cadets into a drum corps dynasty.</p>

          <div alignment="true" class="containerPhotoCaption">Debra Barcus (center), Lee Ann (to her left) and Linda Riley (to her right) all were members of The Cadets color guard in the mid 1980s. All three women say they were sexually abused by George Hopkins, the corps longtime director.</div>
        </div>
      </div>


      <p>Flattered to have been singled out amid the other performers, the sisters went out that night with Hopkins and another male instructor. Lee Ann said she gave it little thought when, leaving the bar, Hopkins offered to drive her and said the other
        instructor would take Linda. When Hopkins pulled into a hotel, she still assumed the best -- that the others would meet them shortly and they would continue their evening out.</p>

      <p>Once in the room, however, she quickly realized Hopkins had something else in mind. She said he forced himself upon her.</p>
      <p>She remembers lying nearly motionless as Hopkins had sex with her, wondering if this was what it meant to be one of the assistant director&rsquo;s favorites.</p>






      <p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s how I partly got through it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was to tell myself, &lsquo;You were chosen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Her sister Linda said two summers later she would be the one chosen by Hopkins, when he came up behind her in an empty practice room, initiated sex with her and then left with barely a word.</p>
      <p>In all, nine women have told the Inquirer they were sexually harassed or abused by Hopkins, the longtime director of the Allentown-based Cadets. Their stories span four decades, the most recent in 2015, and include accusations of lewd comments,
        groping, and rape. The women, all alumni of The Cadets or former employees, ranged in age from 16 to 37 at the time of the alleged incidents.</p>
      <p>Some detailed abuse they said lasted months.</p>
      <p>Others described a single, unsettling moment when Hopkins crossed the line, like Jess Reynolds, who said Hopkins abruptly pushed her against a wall and kissed her after the two met for dinner in 2007. She said she shoved him off, disappointed in
        her former instructor.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;This is somebody that, in a sense, I looked up to,&rdquo; Reynolds said. &ldquo;I was extremely disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Six of Hopkins&rsquo; accusers agreed to be named, while three others spoke on the condition of either being anonymous or using only their first name. Many of the women said that after years of silence they now feel ready to come forward given the
        national reckoning over sexual harassment that has toppled the careers of powerful men in politics, media and the arts.</p>

      <p>Hopkins, 61, became director of The Cadets in 1982 and has coached the troupe to an impressive 10 world championships while earning a spot in drum corps history as an innovator and mentor to hundreds of teens and young adults.</p>

      <p>The activity, which has a small but devoted following, can be likened to marching band, plus more theatrics and a grueling summer-long performance schedule that takes the members, many aspiring musicians and band directors, from coast to coast.</p>

      <p>The Cadets hold a place of prestige as one of the oldest and most competitive corps. That has earned the team, and Hopkins, prominence outside the activity. The Cadets performed in the closing ceremony for the Atlanta Olympics, marched in President
        Obama&rsquo;s first inaugural parade and in 2016 were the focus of a reality television show.</p>
      <p>Debra Barcus, 54, was a member of color guard from 1978 to 1985, years during which The Cadets became the first to win the national title three years in a row.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It was a wild ride,&rdquo; said Barcus, then Debra Gozdek. &ldquo;You're working hard. You&rsquo;re suffering. It&rsquo;s like being in the Army. You&rsquo;re up at the crack of dawn. Sun poisoning. You&rsquo;re almost killing yourself to
        be the best you can.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The Cadets mentality, she and other members said, is to never complain, despite the difficulty.</p>

      <div alignment="true" class="containerPhotoCaption">Debra &quot; Be Be&quot; Barcus, of North Redington Beach Florida was a member of the Garfield Cadets from 1975-1985. She lived in Garfield, NJ then. She was 14 years old when she began touring with the marching band. She states she was sexually

      <p>So that is what Barcus said she did when in the summer of 1980 when Hopkins sat next to her on a dark bus and began to grope her. She was 16 and he, 23.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I just froze,&rdquo; Barcus said. &ldquo;He was touching me, trying to kiss me, trying to push my hand down his shorts. And I wouldn&rsquo;t cooperate, but I didn&rsquo;t stop him. Because I couldn&rsquo;t get anything out of my mouth.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Hopkins&rsquo;s influence extends beyond drum corps. He is also CEO of Youth Education in the Arts, a nonprofit that runs The Cadets but also reaches thousands more teens and young adults through its other programs, including a local dance troupe
        and US Bands, which annually runs over 150 high school band competitions in more than 30 states.</p>





      <p>The board of directors for Youth Education in the Arts became aware of several of the women&rsquo;s stories in January. The accounts were provided without the women&rsquo;s names by an attorney working on the women&rsquo;s behalf. The attorney,
        Kevin Hahn, told the board the women may be willing to be interviewed if two conditions were met: that the nonprofit hired an independent investigator to look into the matter and Hopkins be suspended pending the investigation&rsquo;s outcome.</p>



      <p>The board declined and took no action.</p>
      <p>BOARD RESPONSE TK.</p>
      <p>One commonality runs through many of the women&rsquo;s accounts: a love for The Cadets so strong they tolerated Hopkins&rsquo; behavior, either out of fear of losing their spots in the corps or their jobs.</p>
      <p>The nonprofit&rsquo;s office culture compounded problems for several of the women who said they were abused while working for Youth Education in the Arts. Some described Hopkins as a volatile, often verbally abusive boss who pitted employees against
        one another and often shifted job responsibilities in an effort to create chaos.</p>
      <p>The office, with about 40 employees, has no human resources department.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;There is no clear avenue for a grievance,&rdquo; said a now 40-year-old woman who worked for the organization in 2015 and agreed to share her story only if not named. &ldquo;Any path, George controlled.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The woman said Hopkins constantly made inappropriate comments to her, such as sharing intimate details about his sex life, telling her how he lost his virginity and asking her to share the same. He, offered, she said, to pay her registration for
        a personal development workshop he said had helped women who were &ldquo;sexually repressed.&rdquo;</p>

      {% set quote = ["There is no clear avenue for a grievance. Any path, George controlled.", "", "quote"] %} {% include "partials/center-quote.html" %}


      <p>&ldquo;He was constantly pressing on the line,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Working for George was, at the beginning, something that I had always dreamed of doing. And by the end, and very quickly actually, it became clear that there were ulterior motives.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Megh Toth of Monroe Township, N.J. also worked for the nonprofit. She was hired as the director of operations in 2005, after spending five years as a baritone player in the corps and several more summers working as a part-time employee on the summer
        tour.
      </p>
      <p>Toth, then Megh Healy, called it a &ldquo;dream job.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>It was during the following winter, in January 2006, she said, that Hopkins asked her to travel with him to Indianapolis for the annual meeting of drum corps organizations. Hopkins announced at a staff meeting that they would share a room to save
        money. Toth, then 26, was uncomfortable about staying with her 49-year-old boss but felt she could not object in front of her coworkers.</p>
      <p>Her hesitation proved premonitory.</p>
      <p>In the hotel room, once the lights were off, she said, Hopkins crawled into her bed. When he kissed her she tried to push him away, gently at first, she said, and then more forcefully as he persisted. But then her mind turned to the car she was
        paying off, the small apartment she was proud to have rented on her own, and the job she hoped would last a lifetime.</p>
      <p>She worried, she said, that Hopkins would fire her and she would lose it all.</p>
      <p>She stopped protesting, except to keep Hopkins from penetrating her.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;no&rsquo; the entire time. I didn't want this to happen,&rdquo; said Toth, a now 39-year-old mother of twins. &ldquo;And then your brain just goes. Your fight is gone.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The next morning, before Hopkins left to catch a flight, he kissed her, she said. She cried in bed, alone.</p>
      <p>Another former employee who agreed to share her story only if not named said she started working in The Cadets office in the early 1980s, the year after she finished performing. She said one day when she was at the office alone Hopkins came up behind
        her, pulled her up from her chair and walked her to a small closet.</p>
      <p>Inside, she said, he pushed her onto the floor, groped her, stuck his hand down her pants and digitally penetrated her. She said she told him to stop but, when he persisted, didn&rsquo;t fight him off.</p>

      {% set quote = ["I said ‘no’ the entire time. I didn't want this to happen. And then your brain just goes. Your fight is gone.", "Megh Toth", "quote"] %} {% include "partials/center-quote.html" %}


      <p>&ldquo;Back then, we didn&rsquo;t really say &lsquo;no&rsquo; too much. And I really didn&rsquo;t know I could,&rdquo; she said, quietly crying. &ldquo;He tried to kiss me. And I covered my face. And I said, &lsquo;No don't kiss me. No kissing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
      <p>She said that after some time had passed, Hopkins got up, berated her for not enjoying his attention, and left.</p>
      <p>She went back to her desk and kept working.</p>

      <p>The Cadets are among the nation&rsquo;s oldest drum and bugle corps and Hopkins is among the longest serving directors.</p>
      <p>The team, which moved to Allentown in 2004, was founded in 1934 at the Most Holy Name Catholic Church of Garfield, N.J. At the time corps were often sponsored by congregations and VFW halls and performed mostly in local parades.</p>
      <p>The modern version is, to put it lightly, more demanding.</p>


      <p>Performers, ranging in age from 16 to 22, travel from across the country and overseas to be a part of the best corps. Starting in mid-May, they perfect an 11-to-12 minute show with a central theme.The next month, the teams then take to the road
        with a caravan of buses, semi trucks full off equipment and a food truck. Two months of performing culminates in a three-day national championship held in Indianapolis.</p>
      <p>Practices can stretch to 15 hours a day, regardless the weather. Rest days are rare, and injuries are common. Performers often doze on the bus en route to the next site, then slip into sleeping bags on a gym floor before waking a few hours later
        for drills. The year&rsquo;s tour&nbsp;<a href="https://yea.org/programs/cadets/cadets/schedule">schedule</a>&nbsp;will take The Cadets from Seattle, Wash. to Houston, Tx., to Annapolis, Md.</p>

      <p>It is an insular and unique experience, as the members spend virtually every moment together working towards a shared goal.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s intense. It&rsquo;s ridiculous, really,&rdquo; said Toth. &ldquo;But at the time it was my religion, my everything.&rdquo;</p>







      <p>Hopkins, as director, has shaped team&rsquo;s culture. Former Cadets describe him as a charismatic leader who pushed them to dig deep in the pursuit of excellence, both in the performance and in their personal lives. His &ldquo;Hop Talks,&rdquo;
        motivational speeches delivered before the full corp, are a fixture of the summer.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;One of the things I&rsquo;m trying to do with The Cadets,&rdquo; Hopkins said in a 2013 promotional video, &ldquo;is allow someone at 20 to have the knowledge that maybe I, or some of the people that I work with, did not acquire until we
        were 40 or 45 or are still acquiring today at 57 years old. If we can do that and use the drum corps as a framework for something more, then that&rsquo;s what we want to do&rdquo;</p>

      <p>His methods have made The Cadets a force in the drum corps world. They have finished in the top 10 at nationals every year since 1980, the year after Hopkins became director.</p>
      <p>Hopkins recently announced this year&rsquo;s show title: &ldquo;The Conversation: Everyone&rsquo;s Talking and Nobody&rsquo;s Listening.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>It will open with a famous Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel song: The Sound of Silence.</p>
      <p><div class="project-subhead">&lsquo;HOPKINS WAS GOD&rsquo;</div></p>
      <p>Kim Carter wanted to be a Cadet since the summer of 1984 when she saw the corps perform a medley of West Side Story. The girls in the color guard wore gold lam&eacute; blouses and billowy white skirts. She thought it was &ldquo;the most beautiful
        thing in the world.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>She auditioned and made the cut in 1987. And while there were days she said she felt crushed by the weighty expectations, she said she basked in the applause at every performance. The friends she made became family. And she soaked in the lessons
        of every Hop Talk.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It was like Hopkins was God,&rdquo; Carter, then Kim Fenstermaker, said on a recent morning in her Warrington, Bucks County home. &ldquo;When he spoke, you listened.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>After her two years as a Cadet, Carter drifted away from drum corps. When she reconnected in 2005, she was 36-years-old, divorced and a single mother, living in the basement of her parents&rsquo; Lehigh Valley home and surviving on unemployment.</p>
      <p>She decided to volunteer for The Cadets, by then based in Allentown. Carter said that December Hopkins invited her to see a play in Philadelphia, saying they would talk about the possibility of a full-time job for her.</p>
      <p>It was a platonic evening, she recalled, until, on the way to the car after the show, Hopkins grabbed her with no warning and kissed her.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I froze,&rdquo; Carter said. &ldquo;This was a man who had taught me when I was 17 and 18. This was a man I looked up to and respected and admired.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Carter said that over the next few weeks Hopkins pursued a sexual relationship with her, all the while talking about the possibility of hiring her. On more than one occasion, she said, he quipped:&nbsp;<em>I don&rsquo;t know if I want to sleep with you or hire you.</em></p>
      <p>Flattered by the attention from a man she had long idolized, Carter said she fell into a sexual relationship with Hopkins.</p>
      <p>Within weeks, he hired her. She said Hopkins told her their relations had to be kept secret because the nonprofit&rsquo;s board of directors had forbidden him from dating employees. Carter said she disliked the secrecy and worried the relationship
        would interfere with the job. She said she attempted to cut things off.</p>

      <p>Hopkins responded, she said, by interfering with her work, either piling on more tasks or pitting her against other employees.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I felt as though my job was totally based on a quid pro quo. You have sex with me, you keep your job,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You don't have sex with me, you&rsquo;re not going to be working here much longer.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>For months, she said, she lived with that. Then one day, Hopkins told her he needed help finding something in a secluded part of the building. There, he pulled her into a closet and forced her to perform oral sex on him, Carter said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I felt like a whore. This is not me. I&rsquo;m here to do a job. I&rsquo;m here to provide for my child,&rdquo; Carter said. &ldquo;I was so hurt. I was so angry.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>She started refusing Hopkins advances, she said. She left the job in September 2006.</p>

      <p>Carter said she filed a sexual harassment complaint against Hopkins with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She said she quickly decided to drop the case.</p>
      <p>Then, and still today, she struggled with the thought of hurting The Cadets.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I don't want to be known as the person who brought down this great organization. But for my healing, I have to own what happened,&rdquo; Carter said. &ldquo;He made me do things I really didn't want to do. But I did them because I wanted
        a job and I wanted to be a part of this organization that I loved as a young person.&rdquo;</p>

      <p><div class="project-subhead">&lsquo;THIS FELT LIKE DROWNING&rsquo;</div></p>
      <p>One woman who spoke to the Inquirer on the condition of using only her first name, Marie, said she grew up admiring Hopkins, though she never marched with the The Cadets. She was a drum corps fan and often saw him interviewed on television when
        PBS broadcast the national championships live.</p>
      <p>He seemed, she said, like a &ldquo;creative genius.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>In 1999, Marie got a job working for Hopkins through a mutual friend. Then 29, she had just weathered a difficult breakup and was looking for a fresh start. She relocated from North Carolina to New Jersey for the job.</p>
      <p>Marie said the first few weeks were fine. But that quickly changed.</p>
      <p>While watching a Broadway show with others from the company, Hopkins reached over and started caressing her leg, Marie said. A few weeks passed and they never spoke of it.</p>
      <p>Then Hopkins started touching her at work, sliding his hand up her skirt when she stood beside his desk to show him a document or get his signature, she said.</p>
      <p>To avoid that situation, she started standing only across from him.</p>
      <p>Sometimes he would close his office door and lock it, then start fondling or kissing her, Marie said. Other times, she said, Hopkins came up behind her and rubbed against her, his penis erect beneath his pants.</p>
      <p>Marie said she felt trapped. She had little savings and worried about being fired. So rather than push Hopkins away, she said she would gently say no but let him kiss her neck or grope her, hoping it would stop there.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;This felt like drowning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It felt like, what can I do to make this go away as quickly as possible and get myself above water so I can breathe.&rdquo;</p>

      </div>

      <p>Things only escalated. Marie said Hopkins started showing up at her apartment, often seemingly drunk or high. She said he would knock relentlessly on her door, to the point that her landlady, who lived in the building, threatened to call the police.</p>
      <p>She said she was in her bathrobe getting ready for work one day when she heard the knock. She let Hopkins into her living room, then went to get dressed. Hopkins followed her, asking to have sex with her.</p>
      <p>Marie said she told him to leave but Hopkins pleaded, then pushed her on the bed. She said he unzipped his pants, tugged at her robe and raped her.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I just kept saying no, don&rsquo;t do this, I don't want to do this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And he did it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>In the weeks that followed, she found herself emboldened.</p>
      <p>And one day when Hopkins grabbed her at work, she shoved him off and told him to never touch her again. Later that day, she confided in a coworker about some of the abuse.</p>
      <p>That man confirmed to the Inquirer that Marie told him that Hopkins had been sexually harassing her. &ldquo;She was visibly shaken,&rdquo; he said.</p>





      <p>Marie quit shortly after and moved back to North Carolina.</p>
      <p>By then, she had lost more than 30 pounds. The stresses of the job, which often kept her at work until past midnight, had compounded with the stress of navigating Hopkins&rsquo;s advances.</p>
      <p>Marie said she never imagined filing a complaint before leaving. There was no human resources manager to go to, she said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Even if there had been an HR person, I would have assumed telling her would have gotten me fired,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was such a culture that he was untouchable.&rdquo;</p>
      <p><div class="project-subhead">&lsquo;DID YOU BLAME YOURSELF?&rsquo;</div></p>
      <p>Years later, Linda Riley is still shaken by the memory of reuniting with her sister when Hopkins brought her back from the hotel. She said Lee Ann cried as she recalled what had happened.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I shouldn't have let her go,&rdquo; Linda, now 55, said, gasping between sobs. &ldquo;We should have just stayed together.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>She said her sister seemed a shell of herself in the weeks that followed.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You didn't laugh. You didn't talk. You didn't work,&rdquo; Linda said, sitting next to Lee Ann in the Langhorne, Bucks County home they share. &ldquo;You didn't want to see him. And I was worried we weren't going to stay.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Lee Ann said she briefly thought of leaving The Cadets. But they had worked so hard to get there. And she worried how she would explain the decision to her mother. So decided to stay.</p>
      <p>That year, the team would finish in seventh, their best season yet.</p>
      <p>The next, the year Hopkins was named director, they finished third.</p>
      <p>The Cadets were building momentum.</p>
      <p>It was one day the following summer, while the team was preparing for the 1983 tour, Linda said, that she saw Hopkins standing in the doorway of the empty classroom where she was practicing. Michael Jackson played through her boombox. She said he
        came up behind her and asked if he could kiss her. She let him, and things moved quickly from there, she said.</p>

      <p>After they had sex, Hopkins got dressed and left.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I never said yes. And I never said no. But I never said yes,&rdquo; said Linda, who was 19 at the time. &ldquo;I felt pressured and I felt cornered. This is our director.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>She said she worried if she stopped him, Hopkins would send her home.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Get through this. I&rsquo;m not going to tell anybody,&rdquo; she recalled thinking during the assault. &ldquo;And I could still be a Cadet.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>It took her weeks to tell her twin what had happened.</p>
      <p>In the decades that have followed, both sisters said they buried the trauma left by their individual experiences with Hopkins before, in their own time, finding their way to therapy. Only recently, though, did they start to open up more fully to
        one another about the pain they share.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Can I ask you a question?&rdquo; Lee Ann asked her sister on a recent morning in their home. &ldquo;Did you blame yourself?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yes. I did,&rdquo; Linda said. &ldquo;I blamed myself. Why couldn't I do something different? &hellip; And I still do blame myself.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Lee Ann nodded.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I totally understand.&rdquo;</p>
